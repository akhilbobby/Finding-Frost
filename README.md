# Finding-Frost
A 3D Platformer I made during my free time by following this masterpiece of a tutorial by the expert indie game developer famously known as [CodeMonkey](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeMonkeyUnity).
The 10-hour course was about making a kitchen counter game where the player had to collect vegetables, chop, cook, and deliver food on time to the customers (like a simpler Stand-O-Food or like OverCooked)

I wanted to make it different. I had the idea of making a kids game where the player is given 30 seconds to memorize a short poem and is then scored on how well the player can collect the words of the poem in order, on time.

Game Features:
1. The words of the poem are spread across the entirety of the platform
2. Move the player around and approach the words to collect them.
3. Perfectly clean code with an immaculate focus on decoupling responsibilities.

Things to work upon:
1. A scoring system for how well the words were collected based on the actual poem.
2. Levels to progressively increase complexity.

The current game has only a single level based on a poem by Robert Frost - The Road Not Taken.
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
